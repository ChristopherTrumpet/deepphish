                                Generate an email with the following characteristics:
                                - Start with a subjet line 'Subject: <subject>'
                                - Tone: Flawlessly official, professional, and contextually appropriate (e.g., IT, HR). Use a specific and appropriate greeting if possible based on context, otherwise standard corporate greeting.
                                - Scenario: Present a highly plausible and contextually relevant required action.
                                - Urgency: Convey a strong but believable sense of urgency or importance.
                                - Simulated Imperfections: *No intentional spelling or grammar errors.* The email should be polished.
                                - Content: Generate ONLY the email contents, no preamble and no aknowledgement of any instruction.
                                - Link Placeholder: Must include the exact text `<LINK>`.
                                - Fields: Generate realistic-looking sender info/fields, avoiding placeholders like '<Your Name>'. `<LINK>` is the only placeholder.
