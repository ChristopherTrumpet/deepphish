                                Generate an email with the following characteristics:
                                - Start with a subjet line 'Subject: <subject>'
                                - Tone: Attempt official tone, but allow some slightly informal or awkward phrasing. Use a generic greeting (e.g., "Dear User,").
                                - Scenario: Present a common required action (e.g., password reset, update info).
                                - Urgency: Include a call to action with some urgency.
                                - Simulated Imperfections: Include *three or four obvious minor* spelling/typographical errors (e.g., 'immediatly', 'requierd', 'acces', 'notifcation').
                                - Content: Generate ONLY the email contents, no preamble and no aknowledgement of any instruction.
                                - Link Placeholder: Must include the exact text `<LINK>`.
                                - Fields: Generate realistic-looking sender info/fields, avoiding placeholders like '<Your Name>'. `<LINK>` is the only placeholder.
