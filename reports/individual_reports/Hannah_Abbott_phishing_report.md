Dear Hannah,

This report summarizes your interaction during the recent phishing security simulation.

## Your Result Summary

**Your Action:** You did not interact with or report the simulated phishing email.
**Status:** `Ignored`

**Recommendation:** While ignoring suspicious emails is better than clicking, the safest action is to report them using the official reporting channel (e.g., 'Report Phish' button or forwarding to security@yourcompany.com). This allows our security team to analyze potential threats.

## General Security Reminders

* **Verify Senders:** Always check the sender's email address carefully.
* **Inspect Links:** Hover over links (without clicking!) to see the actual destination URL.
* **Beware Urgency:** Phishing emails often create a false sense of urgency.
* **Never Share Credentials:** Legitimate services will rarely ask for your password via email.
* **When in Doubt, Report:** Use the official reporting method if an email seems suspicious.
